## Roadmap
Future plans include modernizing the user Interface/user experience (UI/UX) to reflect a more modern game design with muted purple, pink and off black. This would be easy to accomplish by referencing relevant sites for inspiration:
•	https://dribbble.com/tags/game_app 
•	https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_hues.asp
•	https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/1011887 
Implementing sound effects onClick. Many sites offer free sound bytes such as freesound.com. Also, implement a restart for when no winner is declared.
